### Information
LWC is the longest-lived single block protection plugin, that protects both the blocks themselves and their contents. Originally designed in 2010 for locking chests (hence the name "Lightweight Chests"), it can be configured to lock any block.

Please see our [wiki](https://github.com/Tsuser1/Modern-LWC/wiki) for important information about setting up and using the plugin.
